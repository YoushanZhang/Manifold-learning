# Manifold-learning

This directory contains the code for manifold lerning, it has three demos: Demo_Sphere_PGA, Demo_Sphere_K_means_PGA and Demo_CC_K_means_PGA. They show the results of principal geodesic analysis (PGA) and K-mean PGA using 3D sphere and 2D corpus callosum data.


It includes two important concepts: Logarithmic (Log) map and Exponential (Exp) map, as shown in following figure
